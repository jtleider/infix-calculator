This program allows the user to enter infix
expressions. These expressions are processed,
converted to postfix expressions, and evaluated.
To run the program, run "make" (or just "make main")
and then "./main".

In general, the results of entering malformed infix expressions
are undefined, although in certain cases the program will point out errors
in formatting. Multiple unary minuses applied to a single
value are considered malformed input. Unary minus is
applied prior to any other operator; for instance, -2^2
evaluates to 4.

Technical documentation about the program, generated by
Doxygen, can be found in the latex/ and html/ subdirectories
after running "make" or "make doc".
